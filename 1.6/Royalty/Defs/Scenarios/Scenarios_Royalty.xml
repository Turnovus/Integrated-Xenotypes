        <description>You were once a great noble, until your every worldly possession was taken from you. You've escaped an attempt on your life, but are now stranded and alone.\n\nNote: Since you begin with a stuck-up noble and no possessions, this scenario can be tricky for newer players.</description>

Your contemporaries schemed against you, and you soon found yourself tricked, betrayed, and backstabbed all the way down to rock bottom. Your enemies took your every worldly possession, and you've narrowly escaped their attempt to take your life.\n\nWith a damaged shuttle and no place to go, you soon find yourself lost in the middle of nowhere. You carry nothing but your royal blood, and the clothes on your back. Will you climb your way back to the top? Or will you perish here, alone and forgotten?</text>
