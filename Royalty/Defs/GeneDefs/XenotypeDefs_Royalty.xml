        <description>The creation of the regalid geneline was commissioned by an ancient noble family and serves a twofold purpose. Firstly, regalids are naturally adept at the skills required of nobility, from charisma and speechcraft to dueling and psychic manipulation. Secondly, their striking appearance is meant to serve as a hereditary symbol of power and honor, to separate royal bloodlines from the common rabble.\n\nRegalids excel at charming anyone they can and slaughtering those they can't. They are, however, totally absent in those positions demanding any sort of strenuous labor.</description>
        <descriptionShort>Regalids carry a "designer geneline," and tend to be prominent figures in class-based societies. They're well suited for positions of power and have a strong aptitude for psychics, but lack the fortitude for hard living.</descriptionShort>
